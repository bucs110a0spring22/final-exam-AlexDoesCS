Summary of Program:
I wanted to combine a fact API with images so I made a code that when ran, it provides Dog Facts while showing a random image of a dog!

Most Challenging topic in the course:
APIs was the most challenging topic. Even though this was the last thing there was, there was so many different aspects within using APIs that felt more challenging than previous codes.
